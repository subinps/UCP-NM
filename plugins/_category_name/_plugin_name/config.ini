# before accept the plugin. you can get the core version simple using .core cmd in userge.

# env vars keys separated using commas.
# ex: HEROKU_API_KEY, HEROKU_APP_NAME
# if one or many env vars are missing, the plugin will not be loaded.

# the plugin will be ignored if there is a conflict.

depends:
# mention all the required plugins to use this plugin.
# plugins names separated using commas.
